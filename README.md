# _Machine Learning, University of Washington - Coursera_

- This repo contains the solution of [University of Washington](coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) machine learning course.

- In this you'll find all courses' answer notebooks.

- In some course I might have uploaded both turicreate and pandas notebooks. Mostly in latter courses I've used pandas.
